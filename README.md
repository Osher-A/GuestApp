# GuestApp

This is a app that organizes lists of guests for big events. 
With this app one can create and store lists of guests with all their details. 
Once a list has been created, one can easily search through the list for a specific guest or group of guests.
There is also the option to create a sublist from one of the lists, and then to save the list (or any other list) in a text file.
Additionally one can use this app to print out labels for any selected list.
